(Ben E. King/Jerry Leiber/Mike Stoller)

When the night is come and the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
I won't be afraid, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand by me
Stand by me, stand by me, stand by me
Won't you stand by me
Oh woo oh, stand by me, stand by me

And when the sky that we look upon
Should crumble and fall
And the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't be afraid, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
Stand by me, stand by me, stand by me
Stand by me
Oh woo oh, you oughta stand by me, stand by me
Stand by me, stand by me, stand by me
Oh woo oh, stand by me
