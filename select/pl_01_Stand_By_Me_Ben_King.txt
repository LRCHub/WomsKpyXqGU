WHEN THE NIGHT HAS COME
AND THE LAND IS DARK
AND THE MOON IS THE ONLY LIGHT
WE SEE
NO I WON'T BE AFRAID
NO I WON'T BE AFRAID
JUST AS LONG AS YOU STAND,
STAND BY ME
AND DARLING, DARLING STAND BY ME
OH, NOW, NOW, STAND BY ME
STAND BY ME, STAND BY ME
IF THE SKY THAT WE LOOK UPON
SHOULD TUMBLE AND FALL
AND THE MOUNTAIN SHOULD CRUMBLE
TO THE SEA

I WON'T CRY, I WON'T CRY
NO I WON'T SHED A TEAR
JUST AS LONG AS YOU STAND,
STAND BY ME
AND DARLING, DARLING STAND BY ME
OH, STAND BY ME
STAND BY ME, STAND BY ME, STAND
BY ME
WHENEVER YOU'RE IN TROUBLE
WON'T YOU STAND BY ME
OH, NOW, NOW, STAND BY ME
OH, STAND BY ME, STAND BY ME,
STAND BY ME
DARLING, DARLING STAND BY ME
STAND BY ME
OH STAND BY ME, STAND BY ME,
STAND BY ME
